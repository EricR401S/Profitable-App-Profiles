# Profitable-App-Profiles
The main aim of this Dataquest project is to identify what kinds of free and English apps attract more users and on the the app stores of both platforms. For this project, I am a data analyst for a company that makes apps for the Google Play and the IOS App Store. The company builds apps in English that are free to download and install, so its only source of income comes from ad revenue based on the number of users that see and interact with the advertisements.
