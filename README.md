# Identifying profitable app profiles from Google and IOS app store data

## Introduction

Greetings, my name is Eric. The main aim of this Dataquest project is to identify what kinds of free and English apps attract more users and on the the app stores of both platforms. For this project, I am a data analyst for a company that makes apps for the Google Play and the IOS App Store. The company builds apps in English that are free to download and install, so its only source of income comes from ad revenue based on the number of users that see and interact with the advertisements. 

The approach to handle this project will consist of opening the tabular Google Play (2017) and IOS (2018) [datasets](https://github.com/dataquestio/solutions/blob/master/Mission350Solutions.ipynb) as a list of lists. The following step will be to clean the data and have only complete, free and English app records remaining. The last step will be to identify popular apps  based on either the genre app pool or the user downloads.

## Summary of Results

The main results across both datasets were that social media apps or apps with very strong social elements were the most prevalent profile. For the Google Play store, communication, video-playing and social apps were the most popular according to user downloads. For the IOS app store, reference and social networking apps show the highest engagement, as well as the runner-ups navigation, music, and weather. I achieved my goal for this project, which was to look for some profitable insights inside the data because I'm very curious about how it behaved.
